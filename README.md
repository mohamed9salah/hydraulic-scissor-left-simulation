# hydraulic-scissor-left-simulation
This project focuses on the comprehensive design and simulation of a hydraulic scissor lift. The design is created using SolidWorks, providing a detailed 3D model of the scissor lift mechanism. Additionally, a circuit simulation is performed using FluidSIM to analyze the hydraulic system's behavior and performance. The project also includes an electrical system integration for the scissor lift, with corresponding graphs and data to illustrate the operational dynamics. This combination of mechanical design, hydraulic simulation, and electrical analysis offers a complete overview of the scissor lift's functionality, making it a valuable resource for understanding the intricate details of such systems.

- compressor
- 3/2 way valve
- 5/2 way valve
- one way flow control valve
- 3 cylinders
Valve 2 controls all cylinders, inlet and outlet. Since the hydraulic shears are slow moving, we must control the valve to control the shears speed. It is set to 3%.

When the simulation starts - as shown in the graph - the air compressor produces gas for the cylinders and the cylinders remain in their positions unchanged and their speed is zero.

When button 2 is pressed back, the cylinders will go back in, controlling the speed.
